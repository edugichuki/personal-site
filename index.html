            <p>I started my journey to become a self-taught developer towards the end of the year 2022. What really spark up my interest is first, the love of technology.: Software developers are at the forefront of technological advancements,I find the constant evolution of technology to be exciting and motivating.I also have a ❤ passion for problem-solving: Software development is a challenging field that requires a lot of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. For me, the satisfaction of solving complex problems is a big draw. The opportunity to create is another motivation: Software development allows you to create something from nothing. Whether it's an app, a website, or a video game, developers have the ability to turn their ideas into reality. Good career prospects is yet another thing that makes me passionate about this field: Software development is a field with a high demand and good career prospects with good pay as well and the ability to work remotely: With the rise of remote work, software development offers the ability to work from anywhere and to have more flexibility on one's schedule.</p>
